# Roll20 DnD 5e macros
A set of scripts and templates to create Dungeons and Dragons (5th edition) macros for roll20 - optimised for the Roll20 official character sheet.  

The scripts might be useful to Roll20 DnD GMs and players alike - especially new ones (like me). They enhance the Roll20 experience by providing macro based abilities to display relevant information for characters, NPCs and monsters.

It's also my personal playground for bash scripting and github actions, hence...

## Shout out to the Roll20 Community
A lot of the macro logic is based on work of other people, mostly found in the [Roll20 community](https://app.roll20.net/forum/). I intend to give credit to the various people for their work...but I might miss some. Please accept my excuse, should you be amongst them. =o)

## Character Macros
### Character Spells list
A set of macros to display a magic wielding character's list of spells.  
The [/documentation/character](https://github.com/wisogetnid/roll20-dnd-5e-macros/tree/master/documentation/character) folder contains documentation for the macros to display a character's spell list. Depending on the maximum level of known spells, there are more or less macros to add. The documentation starts with `doc_character-spells_` followed by the maximum spell level. For a character knowing up to 2nd level spells, have a look at the [doc_character-spells_level-2.md](https://github.com/wisogetnid/roll20-dnd-5e-macros/tree/master/documentation/character/doc_character-spells_level-2.md)

### Character Traits & Features list
A set of macros to display a character's list of traits and features.  
The [/documentation/character](https://github.com/wisogetnid/roll20-dnd-5e-macros/tree/master/documentation/character) folder contains documentation for the macros to display a character's traits and features. The documentation is called [doc_character-traits.md](https://github.com/wisogetnid/roll20-dnd-5e-macros/tree/master/documentation/character/doc_character-traits.md).
