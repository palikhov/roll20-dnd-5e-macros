## Generic "spellcard" Characters and "$" Abilities
Create a new, generic Character for every different "spellcard". These are placeholders to display the individual spells.  
On every of those "spellcard" Characters, add 10 (or more) Abilities "$0", "$1"...until "$9", depending on the maximum of known spells of a certain level. 
### Example
As an example, Character "spellcard1", Ability "$0" will display the first spell ($0 Ability) of the 1st level (spellcard1 Character) spells of the selected token/character.
