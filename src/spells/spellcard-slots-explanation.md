## Generic "spellcard" Characters and "spell" Abilities
Create a new, generic "spellcard" Character for every spell level casters have spells. These are placeholders to display the individual spells.  
On every of those "spellcard" Characters, add 10 (or more) Abilities "spell0", "spell1"...until "spell9", depending on the maximum of known spells of a certain level. 
### Example
As an example, Character "spellcard1", Ability "spell0" will display the first spell (spell0 Ability) of the 1st level (spellcard1 Character) spells of the selected token/character.
